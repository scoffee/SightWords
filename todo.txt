Consider options to make the game more visually complex and interesting


- create bouncing balls with buttons
  - each button has a size based on word length, mass based on size
  - collisions are perfectly elastic
    - calculate impact energy perpendicular to contact point, based on mass and perpendicular speed component
    - apply impact energy to both, compensating for mass
    - can animarions be interrupted?
    - set timer to check collisions
- start with static word list
- present randomized play field
- show four choices
- wait for correct choice
- repeat
- choose random word and play sound
- determine best audio format based on size/quality ratio - probably mono mp3 at low data rate
  - research compatibility across platforms
- show correct word and some random words
- wait for child to choose
- replay word every few second or on a bad choice
- sound effects for right/wrong choice
- animate words as bouncing bubbles
  - include rotation?
- set up list of sight words as xml
  - perhaps a generic q/a file, which could include text/audio/visual/point value and other properties in knowledge list
    - this could even be used as a music memory trainer
    - aftermarket content might make this a user supported games
    - other games/apps could support the same knowledge file format
    - text to speech and voice recognition would be very cool features
- think about ways to turn this into a game
  - points
  - achievements
  - embed in another game, where choosing the right word is just a part of the game
    - aliens encroach, speaking words.  They can only be defeated by dropping/shooting with the correct word
      - could be used for other choices, such as antonyms, spelling, math, jeopardy-like questions
    - falling objects, similar to tux math
    - 
- when choosing decoy words, use a weighted average based on history.
- present words as decoys that have not been presented with the answer word
- consider for decoys both words incorrectly chosen when the current 
	correct word was presented and also words that were the correct answer
	when the current correct word was incorrectly chosen.
  

-  how do we keep the database in sync after updates

Future options
